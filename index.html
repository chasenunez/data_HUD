    <h1> Data Description </h1>
    <p>
        The **Iris dataset** is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, often used for classification tasks. It was introduced by the British biologist and statistician **Sir Ronald A. Fisher** in his 1936 paper, "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems." The dataset consists of 150 samples from three different species of iris flowers: *Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*. Each species is represented by 50 samples, with four features recorded for each sample: the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width (all in centimeters).

        The Iris dataset is frequently used for testing and demonstrating various machine learning algorithms, particularly in classification tasks. It is often cited in textbooks and tutorials as a simple, clean, and well-understood example for introducing concepts such as supervised learning, clustering, and statistical analysis.

        Over time, the dataset has become a benchmark for evaluating algorithms, and its relatively simple structure makes it ideal for educational purposes. The dataset is included in various programming libraries, including R and Python’s `sklearn`, and continues to serve as a foundational resource for data scientists and statisticians.
